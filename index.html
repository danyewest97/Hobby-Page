      The clarinet is a fairly old instrument, invented around the year 1690 by Johann Christoph Denner. It was based on an earlier instrument called the chalumeau. However, the chalumeau didn't have a very high range;
      it couldn't play very high notes. So, Denner added the "register key" that was a key that let out air near the top of the instrument and allowed it to play higher notes.

		The clarinet itself is a long, usually wooden cylinder, with holes cut out for air to escape. This allows for players to be able to change the pitch of the instrument by covering holes.

       Because of the register key, the clarinet could play a lot more notes than the chalumeau, due to the register key allowing much easier "overblowing" of notes, which could raise a note's pitch by 12 full notes. This opened up a whole lot more possibilities for songs and pieces that could be played by the clarinet.

			Here are examples of the chalumeau and clarinet being played. One thing to notice is that the clarinet plays much higher notes, made possible with the register key.
